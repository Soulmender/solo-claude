# `.repo-meta.yaml` — canonical schema

This file lives at the root of any repo that uses the `solo-claude` skills. It pins per-repo context (GitHub owner/repo, monorepo layout, docs paths, label/milestone conventions, audit artifact paths) so skills don't re-prompt for the same answers every run.

If a skill needs context that's not in `.repo-meta.yaml`, it asks once and offers to add the answer to the file.

## Minimal example

```yaml
repo_name: my-app
github:
  owner: peter
  repo: my-app
monorepo:
  layout: pnpm-workspaces
  packages_root: packages/
docs:
  layout: docs-folder-plus-readme
  docs_root: docs/
audit: {}  # auto-managed by repo-audit / repo-verifier / docs-author
```

## Field-by-field

### `repo_name` (required)

Used as a fallback identifier when GitHub MCP isn't authenticated. Human-readable, kebab-case.

### `github` (recommended)

`owner` and `repo` are the GitHub coordinates. The GitHub MCP uses them to fetch issues and PRs without asking each run.

`default_branch` defaults to `main` if not set. Skills that need a base for diffing (code-review, release-notes) use this.

`labels` documents what label sets exist in your repo. `github-issue-creator` validates applied labels against this list; `workflow-hygiene-check` flags unlabeled issues against the `type:` and `area:` namespaces specifically. The categorization (`type`, `area`, `other`) is convention only — GitHub doesn't enforce label namespaces.

`milestone_pattern` is a regex. `release-notes` uses it to map closed milestones to release versions. The default `v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+` matches `v1.2.3` and `1.2.3`.

### `monorepo` (required)

`layout` is one of `pnpm-workspaces`, `yarn-workspaces`, `turborepo`, `nx`, `uv-workspaces`, `poetry-monorepo`, `single-package`. The audit skill uses it to know how to walk packages and read manifests.

`packages_root` is the folder containing package subdirectories. Most monorepos use `packages/` (or `apps/` + `packages/` for app/lib split — you can list both in `packages_root` as a list).

`packages` is an optional explicit list. Useful when package names (`@my-app/web`) diverge from folder names (`packages/web`), or when one folder isn't a package. `role` is `app | library | tool | infra` for downstream skills to weight findings.

### `docs` (required)

`layout` selects how the docs-author and docs-update skills behave:

- `docs-folder-plus-readme` — `docs/` for everything beyond `README.md`. Default.
- `mkdocs` — same as above plus `mkdocs.yml` nav updates when adding pages.
- `docusaurus` — same as above plus Docusaurus sidebar updates.
- `readme-only` — no `docs/` folder; everything lives in README sections. docs-author maintains README sections only.

`docs_root` is `docs/` for the first three. Ignored for `readme-only`.

`adr_root` and `rfc_root` are where ADRs and RFCs live. Defaults: `docs/adrs/` and `docs/proposals/`.

`preserved_sections` lists heading texts under which `docs-author` and `docs-update` will not overwrite content. Defaults to `## Manual notes`. Add more if your team has another preservation convention.

### `release` (recommended)

`versioning` is `semver`, `calver`, or `none`. `release-notes` uses this to compute the next version.

`changelog_path` is where the changelog lives. Defaults to `CHANGELOG.md` at the root.

`tag_format` is the template for release tags. Defaults to `v{version}`.

### `audit` (auto-managed)

The audit / verifier / docs-author skills maintain this block. The user pins paths (`report_md`, `report_json`, etc.) on first run; subsequent runs update `last_run` and `commit`.

### `contributors` (optional)

Useful when the repo has more than one contributor and ownership matters for review or planning. Skills surface contributor handles in audit reports and docs when this is set.

## Auto-discovery

If `.repo-meta.yaml` is missing or partial when a skill needs it, the skill offers to run `scaffold-repo-meta`, which:

1. Reads the GitHub remote URL to fill `github.owner` and `github.repo`.
2. Detects the monorepo layout from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json` `workspaces`, `turbo.json`, `nx.json`, `pyproject.toml` `[tool.uv.workspaces]`, etc.
3. Detects the docs layout from the presence of `docs/`, `mkdocs.yml`, `docusaurus.config.*`, or absence of any.
4. Detects versioning from `CHANGELOG.md` patterns and existing tags.
5. Asks for the rest.

## Validation

`scaffold-repo-meta --check` (or running any skill with a malformed file) prints schema violations:

- `monorepo.layout` not in the allowed set
- `docs.layout` not in the allowed set
- `github.owner`/`github.repo` missing
- `audit.*` paths pointing at non-existent files (warning, not error)
